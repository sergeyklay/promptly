# The application supports different startup modes:
#    - development
#    - testing
#    - production
#    - default (alias for development)
#
# To specify an application's startup mode, set the variable
# PROMPTLY_CONFIG to an appropriate value as follows:
#
#   $ export PROMPTLY_CONFIG=production
#   $ flask --app runner:app run
#
# Please note: When starting the application with flask script (which
# is by design the way to run an application in development mode), the
# --debug command line flag has nothing to do with the value of
# PROMPTLY_CONFIG variable because they are handled differently, by
# different subsystems. Thus, the following way of starting is
# perfectly functional (although it makes no sense):
#
#   $ export PROMPTLY_CONFIG=production
#   $ flask --app runner:app run --debug
#
config = os.getenv('PROMPTLY_CONFIG', 'default').lower()
app = create_app(config)

# The alternative way to start the application is through the
# Flask.run() method. This will immediately launch a local server
# exactly the same way the flask script does.
#
# The following code is for starting an application using only one of
# the following launch methods:
#
#   $ python runner.py
#   $ ./runner.py
#
# It will NOT be executed with the following launch methods:
#
#   $ flask --app runner:app run
#
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
