# connections. By default, Flask uses the value '127.0.0.1' (localhost), which
# means that the server will be accessible only on the local machine. If you
# want to make the server accessible to external clients, you can set
# FLASK_RUN_HOST to the value '0.0.0.0' or another IP address of your server.
