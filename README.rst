Welcome to Promptly, an open-source research project aimed at interacting with
OpenAPI compatible language models. If you're an engineer, data scientist, or
just an enthusiast looking for fine-grained control over your conversational
model, you're in the right place.

This project isn't production-ready. It's more like a sandbox where you can mess
around with prompt injections, fine-tuning, and much more. Do expect bugs; after
all, that's part of the fun!

Features:

- **Customizable API Calls:** Go beyond the traditional ChatGPT API limitations.
- **Prompt Injection:** Want to steer the conversation? Inject prompts to guide
  the model.
- **Fine-Tuning Support:** Got a model that's been fine-tuned? This project has
  you covered.
- **Multiple Models:** This isn't a one-trick pony. Use any OpenAPI-compatible
  model you like.
