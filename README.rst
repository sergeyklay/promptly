Welcome to Promptly, an open-source research project aimed at interacting with
OpenAPI compatible language models. If you're an engineer, data scientist, or
just an enthusiast looking for fine-grained control over your conversational
model, you're in the right place.

This project isn't production-ready. It's more like a sandbox where you can mess
around with prompt injections, fine-tuning, and much more. Do expect bugs; after
all, that's part of the fun!

Features:

- **Customizable API Calls:** Go beyond the traditional ChatGPT API limitations.
- **Prompt Injection:** Want to steer the conversation? Inject prompts to guide
  the model.
- **Fine-Tuning Support:** Got a model that's been fine-tuned? This project has
  you covered.
- **Multiple Models:** This isn't a one-trick pony. Use any OpenAPI-compatible
  model you like.

Local Development
=================

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment for local development to
keep the dependencies required by different projects separate and to avoid
potential conflicts. A virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree
that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a
number of additional packages. This way, you can work on your project using its
specific dependencies, without any interference with other projects or system
libraries.

To create a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Install `virtualenv` if you haven't already:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install virtualenv

2. Navigate to your project directory
   (assuming you've already cloned the repository):

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd promptly

3. Create a virtual environment in the project directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ virtualenv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: console

   # On Unix or MacOS, use:
   $ source venv/bin/activate

   # On Windows use:
   $ .\venv\Scripts\activate

Now you're in the virtual environment, and you can install dependencies isolated
from your global environment.

For more information on virtual environments, check out the official
`Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_.


Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python >= 3.10
- Your favorite text editor
  (*If you're an Emacs hacker, you'll feel right at home*)
- Basic understanding of OpenAPI, web development, and how GPT models work

Installing
----------

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/sergeyklay/promptly.git
   $ cd promptly

Install the necessary Python libraries:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make init
   $ make install

Run database migrations:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make migrate


Finally the necessary JS libraries:

.. code-block:: console

   $ npm ci

Optionally you can add seed (fake) data to the database:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make seed
